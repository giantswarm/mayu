# Development

A Go 1.7+ [environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) and the `blkid.h` headers are required.

```sh
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libblkid-dev

# RPM-based
sudo dnf install libblkid-devel
```

## Generate

Install [schematyper](https://github.com/idubinskiy/schematyper) to generate Go structs from JSON schema definitions.

```sh
go get -u github.com/idubinskiy/schematyper
```

Use the tool to generate `config/types/schema.go` whenever the `schema/ignition.json` is modified.

```sh
./generate
```

## Vendor

Install [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) and [glide-vc](https://github.com/sgotti/glide-vc) to manage dependencies in the `vendor` directory.

```sh
go get -u github.com/Masterminds/glide
go get -u github.com/sgotti/glide-vc
```

Edit the `glide.yaml` file to update a dependency or add a new dependency. Then make vendor.

```sh
make vendor
```

## Running Blackbox Tests on Container Linux

Build both the Ignition & test binaries inside of a docker container, for this
example it will be building from the ignition-builder-1.8 image and targeting
the amd64 architecture.

```sh
docker run --rm -e TARGET=amd64 -e ACTION=COMPILE -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp quay.io/coreos/ignition-builder-1.8 ./test
sudo -E PATH=$PWD/bin/amd64:$PATH ./tests.test
```

## Test Host System Dependencies

The following packages are required by the Blackbox Test:

* `util-linux`
* `dosfstools`
* `e2fsprogs`
* `btrfs-progs`
* `xfsprogs`
* `uuid-runtime`
* `gdisk`
* `coreutils`

## Writing Blackbox Tests

To add a blackbox test create a function which yields a `Test` object. A `Test`
object consists of the following fields:

Name: `string`

In: `[]Disk` object, which describes the Disks that should be created before
Ignition is run.

Out: `[]Disk` object, which describes the Disks that should be present after
Ignition is run.

MntDevices: `MntDevice` object, which describes any disk related variable
replacements that need to be done to the Ignition config before Ignition is
run. This is done so that disks which are created during the test run can be
referenced inside of an Ignition config.

Config: `string`

The test should be added to the init function inside of the test file. If the
test module is being created then an `init` function should be created which
registers the tests and the package must be imported inside of
`tests/registry/registry.go` to allow for discovery.
