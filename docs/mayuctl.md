# `mayuctl` - The Mayu Client

`mayuctl` is a client implementation to interact with `mayu`. By default TLS
is enabled. If your setup does not provide or rely on TLS for whatever reasons,
you can use the `--no-tls` flag to disable TLS and only communicate over
HTTP. The corresponding option for `mayuctl` can be set as flag for `mayu` too.

## Help Usage

Lets have a look at the help usage.

```nohighlight
Manage a mayu cluster

Usage:
  mayuctl [flags]
  mayuctl [command]

Available Commands:
  version       Show cli version
  list          List machines.
  status        Status of a host.
  set           Set metadata of machines (metadata, providerid, ipmiaddr, cabinet, state, etcdtoken).
  boot-complete Change the state of a host to 'running' (only run on provisioned machines).
  etcd-clusters Manage etcd clusters
  override      Overrides globally defined properties for a host: docker_version, yochu_version, etc

Flags:
  -d, --debug[=false]: Print debug output
      --host="localhost": Host name to connect to mayu service
      --no-tls[=false]: Do not use TLS communication
      --port=4080: Port to connect to mayu service
  -v, --verbose[=false]: Print verbose output

Use "mayuctl [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## List Machines

Checking what machines are within a cluster can be done using the `list`
command. You should see output like this.

```nohighlight
$ mayuctl list
IP           Serial                                Profile  State      Last Boot
172.17.8.31  004b27ed-692e-b32e-1f68-d89aff66c71b  core     "running"  2016-01-15 13:42:33.344687863 +0000 UTC
```

You can also change the fields that should be listed.

```nohighlight
$ mayuctl list -fields=ip,yochu,etcd
IP           YOCHU   ETCD
172.17.8.31  0.19.1  v2.2.5-gs-1
```

## Check Machine Status

To inspect a machine's status there is the `status` command. The output should
be something like this.

```nohighlight
$ mayuctl status 004b27ed-692e-b32e-1f68-d89aff66c71b
Serial:              004b27ed-692e-b32e-1f68-d89aff66c71b

```

## Set Metadata to the Machines

To set the value of properties for a machine such as the ip address, state, the
fleet Metadata and more. You can use the command `set` by specifying its serial
number.

```nohighlight
$ mayuctl set 004b27ed-692e-b32e-1f68-d89aff66c71b state configured

...

$ mayuctl set 004b27ed-692e-b32e-1f68-d89aff66c71b cabinet 1
```


## Override properties in the Machines

You can use the command `override` to override the value of properties for a
specific machine by using its serial number. You can override the value of properties
such as the `yochu_version`, `CoreOSVersion`, etc...

```nohighlight
$ mayuctl override 004b27ed-692e-b32e-1f68-d89aff66c71b CoreOSVersion 899.13.0

...

$ mayuctl override 004b27ed-692e-b32e-1f68-d89aff66c71b yochu_version v0.19.1
```

##Â Upgrade installed software versions in the Machines

To upgrade the versions of the software installed in the machines, you can use
the command `boot-complete`. This command enables to change the versions of
`Yochu`, `Fleet`, `etcd`, among others that were initially installed in our machines.

```nohighlight
$ mayuctl boot-complete --update-versions

```
