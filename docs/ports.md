# Mayu Network Requirements

Machines need to be able to connect to Mayu on a few ports. Here is a short list on what is used.

```
PORT    PROTOCOL  DESCRIPTION
4080    TCP       default TLS/HTTP port to communicate the state of the machine and fetch binaries and scripts to provision machines
4081    TCP       default HTTP port for ipxe  endpoints (kernel, initrd and ignition endpoints)
67      UDP       DHCP/BOOTP to let machines boot via PXE/iPXE
69      UDP/TCP   TFTP to ship images via PXE
```
