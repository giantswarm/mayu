# Mayu
Mayu provides a set of mechanisms to bootstrap PXE-enabled bare metal nodes
that must follow a specific configuration with Container Linux. 

## Prerequisites

Mayu requires some basic configuration and layer 2 connectivity to the rest
of the nodes. Usually the cluster’s management node is used for this. The
management node acts as a PXE server and should support three kinds of requests
from the rest of the nodes: PXE, DHCP, and bootp. The rest of the nodes should
be configured to boot via ethernet by default and share a network segment with
the management node, so they get the PXE boot data from the management node on
DHCP request.

Developing Mayu requires the following tools to be installed.

* `wget
* `go-bindata
* `cpio`
